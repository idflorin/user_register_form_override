**Module Version**: 1.0

**Package**: Custom

## Overview

The **User Register Form Override** module provides a simple way to customize the default help text displayed on the user registration form in Drupal. With this module, site administrators can easily change the text for the email and username fields to improve user experience or communicate important information clearly.

## Features

- **Override Email Help Text**: Customize the default help message for the email field on the user registration form.
- **Override Username Help Text**: Change the default help text for the username field to align with your site's requirements.
- **Admin Configuration Page**: Manage text overrides from a dedicated settings page located at `/admin/config/people/user_register_form_override`.
- **Configure Link on Modules Page**: Quick access to the settings page from the `/admin/modules` page using the "Configure" link.
- **Seamless Integration**: The settings link is placed under the "People" section in the Drupal admin menu for easy navigation.

## Installation

1. **Download and Place the Module**:  
   - Place the `user_register_form_override` directory in your `modules/custom` directory within your Drupal installation.

2. **Enable the Module**:  
   - Go to `/admin/modules` and enable "User Register Form Override".
   - Alternatively, use Drush:  
     ```bash
     drush en user_register_form_override
     ```

3. **Clear the Cache**:  
   - After enabling the module, clear the Drupal cache by navigating to `/admin/config/development/performance` and clicking **Clear all caches**, or run:
     ```bash
     drush cr
     ```

## Configuration

## Permissions

The module includes one custom permission:

## Troubleshooting

- **Settings Link Not Visible**: Ensure your user role has the "Administer User Register Form Override settings" permission.

- **Menu Link Placement**: The settings link is nested under `/admin/people`. Verify that your YAML configuration is correct if the link does not appear.
